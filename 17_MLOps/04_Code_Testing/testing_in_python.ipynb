    "So now we're getting into something that is quite important and many people really don't understand and that is mocking or mocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a lots of times when you write tests,\n",
    "\n",
    "There's part of your code that relies on something that's **not active in testing environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, we maybe have this front end code that we're running, and front end code relies on a back end API in order to be working properly.\n",
    "But i dont want to have to spin up the back end API or set up all of these different dependencies just to test the front end. So what i would do is i would mock or create **a facke version of dependency**, in this case, the back end API that returns some fake data so that i can simply test the front end without worrying about all of these other dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to see exactly what i mean in these examples that i go through. But whenever you have kind of a complex system and you want to write a simple unit test, you want that test to be testing that one thing, that one function, that one part of your user interface your front end or whatever. **You don't want it to be kind of dependent on all of these other variables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For examples, you're testing this front end code. Maybe the front end code works file, but there's an error with your API.\n",
    "\n",
    "You wouldn't want the API to trigger and error in your front end testing code, because really there is no error there. it exists somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead you would mock that component, which i'm going to show you here so that you know that you're testing just this isolated area, which is what the unit test is ment to do.\n",

    "    else:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Could not fetch weather data\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's great example, i have this function called get weather. what i want this to do is send a request a network request to this API. Now this API is something i don't control. Maybe one day it goes away or it doesn't work anymore. or maybe i need an API key. Or maybe it's down. i wouldn't want this to make this test fail because that's not my fault. That's not what i'm trying to test, okay ?. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm trying to just test that i wrote this code properly. Not that the APIs working were not working. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to mock this API so that i simply have it return something automatically without having to actually go and send this request.\n",
