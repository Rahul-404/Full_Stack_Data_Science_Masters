    "\n",
    "Here’s a complete code example:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Define the two integer variables\n",
    "num1 = 10\n",
    "num2 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform arithmetic operations\n",

    "\n",
    "### (i) `/` & `//`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`/` (Division Operator)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Performs floating-point division, even if the result is a whole number.\n",
    "   - **Returns**: A float.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 7 / 3\n",
    "     print(result)  # Output: 2.3333333333333335\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`//` (Floor Division Operator)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Performs integer division, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result (i.e., it rounds down).\n",
    "   - **Returns**: An integer (or a float if one of the operands is a float).\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 7 // 3\n",
    "     print(result)  # Output: 2\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Summary**:\n",
    "   - `/` gives a floating-point result.\n",
    "   - `//` gives an integer result (floor division).\n",
    "\n",
    "### (ii) `**` & `^`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`**` (Exponentiation Operator)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Raises a number to the power of another number (i.e., performs exponentiation).\n",
    "   - **Returns**: The result of the exponentiation operation.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 2 ** 3\n",
    "     print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`^` (Bitwise XOR Operator)**:\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation between two integers. It compares the bits of the numbers; if the bits are different, the corresponding bit in the result is set to 1.\n",
    "   - **Returns**: An integer, representing the result of the bitwise XOR operation.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = 5 ^ 3\n",
    "     print(result)  # Output: 6\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     (Explanation: In binary, 5 is `0101` and 3 is `0011`. XOR operation gives `0110`, which is 6 in decimal.)\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Summary**:\n",
    "   - `**` is used for exponentiation (raising to a power).\n",
