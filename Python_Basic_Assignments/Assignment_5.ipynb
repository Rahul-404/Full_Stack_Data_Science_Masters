    "  - Dictionaries store data as pairs of keys and values. Each key is unique and maps to a specific value.\n",
    "  - Access elements using keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access Method**: \n",
    "  - Fast lookup for values using keys. Keys are used to retrieve associated values in constant time, on average.\n",

    "  - Ideal for situations where you need to map unique keys to values, such as in cases where you need to quickly look up data by some identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lists**\n",

    "- **Data Structure**: **Ordered Collection of Elements**\n",
    "  - Lists store data in an ordered sequence. Each element in the list is assigned an index, starting from 0.\n",

    "  - Access elements by their position (index) in the list. Indexing is also efficient, but searching for an element requires iterating through the list unless the index is known.\n",
