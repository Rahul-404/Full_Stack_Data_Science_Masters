    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design and structure software in a way that is both modular and reusable. OOP achieves this through the following key principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: Bundles data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. This hides the internal state of objects and only exposes what is necessary, leading to improved data integrity and reduced complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**: Simplifies complex systems by providing a clear interface and hiding implementation details. It allows programmers to interact with objects at a higher level of abstraction without needing to understand their internal workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**: Enables the creation of new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. This allows new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It supports method overriding and interface implementation, which helps in designing flexible and scalable systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, OOP aims to make software development more manageable, maintainable, and scalable by using these principles to create a more organized and intuitive structure for code."

    "In Python, an object is a fundamental building block that represents a specific instance of data or functionality. Everything in Python is an object, including primitive data types like integers and strings, as well as more complex structures like lists, dictionaries, and custom classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key aspects of objects in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identity**: Each object has a unique identity, which can be checked using the `id()` function. This identity is a reference to the object's location in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Type**: Every object has a type, which determines what kind of data or behavior the object can have. You can use the `type()` function to check an object's type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Value**: The value of an object is the data it represents. For example, an integer object might have a value of `5`, while a string object might have a value of `\"hello\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Attributes and Methods**: Objects can have attributes (data associated with the object) and methods (functions associated with the object). For instance, a list object might have attributes like its length and methods like `append()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mutability**: Objects can be mutable or immutable. Mutable objects, like lists and dictionaries, can be changed after they are created. Immutable objects, like integers and strings, cannot be changed once they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example demonstrating an object in Python:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Define a class\n",

    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of what a class in Python is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**: A class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. The class body contains attributes and methods that describe the behavior and properties of the objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Methods**: These are functions defined within the class that describe the behaviors or actions an object can perform. Methods typically operate on the attributes of the class and can also take parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Instantiation**: Creating an instance (or object) of a class is known as instantiation. Each instance has its own copy of the class attributes and can use the class methods.\n",

    "In Python, class variables and instance variables are both used to store data, but they have different scopes and purposes. Here’s a breakdown of their differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Class Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**: Class variables are variables that are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside any instance methods. They are usually used to store data that is common to all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Usage**: They are used to store properties or constants that are common to all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Class Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    # Class variable\n",
    "    species = \"Canis familiaris\"\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, `species` is a class variable. Changing it via the class affects all instances because the variable is shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instance Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**: Instance variables are variables that are specific to each instance of a class. They are defined within methods (typically the `__init__` method) and are accessed using `self`.\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "In Python class methods, the `self` parameter plays a crucial role. Here’s an overview of its purpose and how it is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose of the `self` Parameter**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accessing Instance Attributes and Methods**:\n",
    "   - The `self` parameter refers to the instance of the class on which the method is called. It allows the method to access and modify the instance’s attributes and other methods.\n",
    "   - By using `self`, you can differentiate between instance attributes and local variables within a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distinguishing Between Instance and Class Variables**:\n",
    "   - Within a method, `self` helps to distinguish instance variables (specific to the current object) from class variables (shared among all instances).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintaining Object State**:\n",
    "   - `self` helps maintain and modify the state of the individual object. When methods operate on `self`, they can change the object's attributes and thereby affect its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Method Invocation**:\n",
    "   - When a method is called on an instance, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument to the method. This is why you need to include `self` in the method definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How `self` Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: `self` is not a keyword in Python; it’s a convention. You can technically name it anything, but `self` is the widely accepted convention and improves code readability.\n",
    "- **Usage**: When you define a method in a class, you must include `self` as the first parameter. When calling the method on an instance, you don’t need to pass `self`; Python does it automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Using `self`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make  # Instance variable\n",
    "        self.model = model  # Instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        # Accessing instance variables using self\n",
    "        return f\"{self.make} {self.model}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def update_model(self, new_model):\n",
    "        # Modifying an instance variable using self\n",
    "        self.model = new_model\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the Car class\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call instance methods\n",
    "print(my_car.display_info())  # Output: Toyota Corolla\n",
    "\n",
    "# Update instance variable through method\n",
    "my_car.update_model(\"Camry\")\n",
    "print(my_car.display_info())  # Output: Toyota Camry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self.make` and `self.model` refer to the instance attributes of the `Car` class.\n",
    "- The `display_info()` method uses `self` to access and return the current state of the `make` and `model` attributes.\n",
    "- The `update_model()` method uses `self` to modify the `model` attribute of the `Car` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `self` parameter is used to access instance attributes and methods from within class methods.\n",
    "- It distinguishes between instance-specific data and class-wide data.\n",
    "- It ensures that methods operate on the correct object instance, allowing for manipulation of object state and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `self` correctly is fundamental to working with classes and objects in Python, as it provides the means to maintain and interact with the state of individual objects."

    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attributes**:\n",
    "   - `ticket_id`: A unique identifier for the ticket.\n",
    "   - `event_name`: The name of the event.\n",
    "   - `event_date`: The date of the event (using `datetime` to handle date operations).\n",
    "   - `venue`: The venue of the event.\n",
    "   - `seat_number`: The seat number associated with the ticket.\n",
    "   - `price`: The price of the ticket.\n",
    "   - `is_reserved`: A boolean indicating whether the ticket is reserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Methods**:\n",
    "   - `reserve_ticket(self)`: Marks the ticket as reserved if it is not already reserved.\n",
    "   - `cancel_reservation(self)`: Cancels the reservation if the ticket is already reserved.\n",
    "   - `display_ticket_info(self)`: Displays information about the ticket, including its attributes and reservation status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Usage**:\n",
    "- Create an instance of the `Ticket` class with relevant details.\n",
    "- Call `reserve_ticket()` to reserve the ticket if it’s not already reserved.\n",
    "- Call `cancel_reservation()` to cancel the reservation if it is already reserved.\n",
    "- Call `display_ticket_info()` to print the ticket details and its reservation status.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class design allows for effective management of ticket reservations and provides methods to handle common operations related to ticket booking."
