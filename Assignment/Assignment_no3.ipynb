    "The `map()` function in Python is used to apply a given function to each item in an iterable (such as a list or tuple) and return a new iterable containing the results. This is a powerful tool for functional programming in Python, allowing you to transform data efficiently without using explicit loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of the `map()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transform Data:**\n",
    "   - `map()` allows you to transform each element of an iterable by applying a function to it. This is useful for operations like data conversion, filtering, or calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Functional Programming:**\n",
    "   - It supports a functional programming style by treating functions as first-class citizens. It avoids the need for explicit loops, making code more concise and expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - `map()` can be more efficient than using a loop because it operates in a more optimized manner internally. It also works with iterators, making it memory efficient for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`function:`** A function that takes one or more arguments and returns a value. This function is applied to each item of the iterable.\n",
    "- **`iterable:`** An iterable (e.g., list, tuple) whose items are passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example demonstrating the `map()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a function that squares a number\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a list of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use map() to apply the square function to each item in the list\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the map object to a list and print the result\n",
    "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function Definition:** The `square()` function takes a number and returns its square.\n",
    "- **Using `map()`:** `map(square, numbers)` applies the `square()` function to each element in the `numbers` list.\n",
    "- **Converting to List:** The result of `map()` is an iterator. Converting it to a list gives the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example with Lambda Function\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a lambda function for concise one-off operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a list of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use map() with a lambda function to double each number\n",
    "doubled_numbers = map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the map object to a list and print the result\n",
    "print(list(doubled_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lambda Function:** `lambda x: x * 2` defines an anonymous function that doubles the input value.\n",
    "- **Applying Lambda:** `map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)` applies this lambda function to each element in the `numbers` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Multiple Iterables\n",
    "\n",
    "`map()` can also handle multiple iterables if the function takes more than one argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a function that adds two numbers\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define two lists\n",
    "list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "list2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use map() to apply the add function to pairs of elements from both lists\n",
    "result = map(add, list1, list2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the map object to a list and print the result\n",
    "print(list(result))  # Output: [5, 7, 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Iterables:** `map(add, list1, list2)` applies the `add()` function to corresponding pairs of elements from `list1` and `list2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** `map()` is used to apply a function to each item in an iterable, transforming the data efficiently.\n",
    "- **Functional Programming:** Supports a functional programming approach, avoiding explicit loops.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Often more efficient than loops and works with large datasets via iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `map()` function is a versatile and powerful tool in Python for transforming data in a concise and readable manner."

    "In MongoDB, the `find()` method is used to query documents from a collection. It allows you to retrieve data based on specific criteria. The `find()` method is one of the most commonly used methods for querying data in MongoDB and provides a flexible way to filter and retrieve documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the `find()` Method Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   db.collection.find(query, projection)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`query` (Optional):** A document that specifies the criteria for the query. Only documents matching this criteria are returned.\n",
    "   - **`projection` (Optional):** A document that specifies which fields to include or exclude from the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Returning a Cursor:**\n",
    "   - The `find()` method returns a cursor, which is an iterator that allows you to iterate over the matching documents. The cursor does not actually retrieve the data until you iterate over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Querying with Criteria:**\n",
    "   - The `query` parameter allows you to specify conditions to filter the documents. This can include simple equality checks, range queries, pattern matching, and more complex queries using MongoDB's query operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Projection:**\n",
    "   - The `projection` parameter allows you to specify which fields to include or exclude in the result. By default, all fields are included in the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Retrieving All Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve all documents from a collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python example using PyMongo\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "collection = db['mycollection']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieve all documents\n",
    "cursor = collection.find()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterate over the cursor and print each document\n",
    "for document in cursor:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Querying with Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve documents that match specific criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Retrieve documents where the 'age' field is greater than 25\n",
    "cursor = collection.find({'age': {'$gt': 25}})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterate over the cursor and print each document\n",
    "for document in cursor:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query Criteria:** `{'age': {'$gt': 25}}` is a query that finds documents where the `age` field is greater than 25.\n",
    "- **Query Operators:** MongoDB supports various operators like `$gt` (greater than), `$lt` (less than), `$eq` (equal to), `$ne` (not equal), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Using Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "To include only specific fields in the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Retrieve documents and include only 'name' and 'age' fields\n",
    "cursor = collection.find({}, {'name': 1, 'age': 1})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterate over the cursor and print each document\n",
    "for document in cursor:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Projection Document:** `{'name': 1, 'age': 1}` specifies that only the `name` and `age` fields should be included in the results. Fields with a value of `1` are included, and fields with a value of `0` are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Querying with Multiple Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "To query with multiple conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Retrieve documents where 'age' is greater than 25 and 'status' is 'active'\n",
    "cursor = collection.find({'age': {'$gt': 25}, 'status': 'active'})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterate over the cursor and print each document\n",
    "for document in cursor:\n",
    "    print(document)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Criteria:** The query combines multiple conditions using the logical `AND` operator. Both conditions must be met for a document to be included in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** The `find()` method retrieves documents from a collection based on specified criteria.\n",
    "- **Cursor:** It returns a cursor that allows iteration over the result set.\n",
    "- **Query Criteria:** Specifies conditions for filtering documents.\n",
    "- **Projection:** Controls which fields are included or excluded in the results.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Supports a wide range of query operators and conditions for flexible querying.\n",

    "Using `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` functions in Python offers several advantages over traditional `for` loops, particularly in terms of readability, conciseness, and functional programming principles. Hereâ€™s a comparison of these functional programming tools with traditional `for` loops and their respective advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Conciseness and Readability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functional Style:**\n",
    "  - Using `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` often results in more concise and readable code. These functions encapsulate common patterns of iteration, making the intent of the code clearer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Less Boilerplate:**\n",
    "  - Functional programming constructs eliminate the need for boilerplate code that typically accompanies `for` loops, such as initializing and updating accumulators.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Mapping Squares of Numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using `map()`:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squares = map(lambda x: x * x, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(squares))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using a `for` Loop:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squares = []\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "    squares.append(number * number)\n",
    "print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Declarative Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expressive Intent:**\n",
    "  - Functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` provide a higher-level, declarative way of expressing what you want to achieve, rather than detailing how to achieve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Filtering Even Numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using `filter()`:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(evens))  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using a `for` Loop:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "evens = []\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "    if number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        evens.append(number)\n",
    "print(evens)  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Functional Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoiding Side Effects:**\n",
    "  - `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` are functional programming tools that avoid side effects. They operate on iterables and return new iterables without modifying the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutability:**\n",
    "  - They support immutability by returning new iterables, making it easier to reason about the code and avoid unintended side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Improved Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimized Implementation:**\n",
    "  - The internal implementation of `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` can be more optimized compared to a custom `for` loop, especially when dealing with large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lazy Evaluation:**\n",
    "  - In Python 3, `map()` and `filter()` return iterators that are lazily evaluated, meaning that they compute values on-the-fly and only as needed. This can be more memory-efficient compared to creating intermediate lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Reducing Product of Numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using `reduce()`:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)\n",
    "print(product)  # Output: 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using a `for` Loop:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "product = 1\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "    product *= number\n",
    "print(product)  # Output: 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Chaining Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pipeline of Transformations:**\n",
    "  - Functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` can be easily chained together, allowing for a pipeline of transformations and operations in a single line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Chaining Map and Filter**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "result = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)))\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: [4, 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Filter Step:** `filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)` filters out odd numbers.\n",
    "- **Map Step:** `map(lambda x: x * 2, ...)` doubles the remaining even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conciseness:** `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` provide more concise and expressive code.\n",
    "- **Readability:** They offer a declarative style that clearly communicates the intent of the code.\n",
    "- **Functional Programming:** These functions support immutability and avoid side effects.\n",
    "- **Performance:** They can be more optimized and memory-efficient, especially with lazy evaluation.\n",
    "- **Chaining:** They enable chaining of operations for complex data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these functional programming tools often results in cleaner, more maintainable, and efficient code compared to traditional `for` loops, particularly for operations that involve transformations, filtering, or reductions."

    "The `map()` function in Python is used to apply a transformation to each element of a list (or any iterable) by passing each element to a specified function. The `map()` function returns an iterator that produces the transformed elements. To get a list of the results, you can convert this iterator to a list using the `list()` constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How `map()` Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Application:**\n",
    "   - The `map()` function applies a specified function to each item in the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Returning an Iterator:**\n",
    "   - It returns an iterator that generates the results of applying the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conversion to List:**\n",
    "   - To get a list of the results, you need to explicitly convert the iterator to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`function:`** A function that takes one or more arguments and returns a transformed value.\n",
    "- **`iterable:`** An iterable (e.g., list, tuple) whose elements will be passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Squaring Each Element in a List\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a function that squares a number\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a list of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use map() to apply the square function to each element in the list\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the result to a list and print it\n",
    "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Function Definition:** `square(x)` returns the square of `x`.\n",
    "- **Using `map()`:** `map(square, numbers)` applies the `square` function to each element in the `numbers` list.\n",
    "- **Conversion to List:** `list(squared_numbers)` converts the iterator to a list of squared numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Using a Lambda Function\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a lambda function for a concise transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a list of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use map() with a lambda function to square each element\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x * x, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the result to a list and print it\n",
    "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Lambda Function:** `lambda x: x * x` defines an anonymous function that squares `x`.\n",
    "- **Using `map()`:** `map(lambda x: x * x, numbers)` applies the lambda function to each element in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Applying Multiple Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply a transformation that involves multiple steps or functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define functions for different transformations\n",
    "def add_one(x):\n",
    "    return x + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a list of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use map() to apply multiple transformations in sequence\n",
    "transformed_numbers = map(square, map(add_one, numbers))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the result to a list and print it\n",
    "print(list(transformed_numbers))  # Output: [4, 9, 16, 25, 36]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Nested `map()` Calls:** The inner `map(add_one, numbers)` first adds `1` to each number. The outer `map(square, ...)` then squares the result.\n",
    "- **Sequential Transformation:** This demonstrates how you can chain multiple transformations using `map()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** `map()` applies a function to each element of an iterable and returns an iterator of transformed values.\n",
    "- **Function and Iterable:** You provide a function and an iterable (like a list) to `map()`.\n",
    "- **Conversion to List:** The result of `map()` is an iterator, which you often convert to a list to see the results.\n",
    "- **Lambda Functions:** `map()` works well with lambda functions for concise transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `map()` function is a powerful and concise way to apply transformations to data in Python, supporting functional programming paradigms and making your code more expressive and readable."

    "\n",
    "### Steps to Insert a Document\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Establish a Connection:**\n",
    "   - Connect to the MongoDB server using `MongoClient`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access the Database:**\n",
    "   - Select the database where you want to perform the operation.\n",

    "   - Select the collection within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Insert the Document:**\n",
    "   - Use one of the insertion methods to add a document to the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s the general syntax for inserting documents into a MongoDB collection using PyMongo:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Insert One Document\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to the MongoDB server\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the database\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the collection\n",

    "\n",
    "# Define the document to be inserted\n",
    "document = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert the document into the collection\n",
    "result = collection.insert_one(document)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the inserted_id\n",
    "print(\"Inserted document ID:\", result.inserted_id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`MongoClient`**: Creates a connection to the MongoDB server.\n",
    "- **`db['mydatabase']`**: Accesses the `mydatabase` database.\n",
    "- **`db['mycollection']`**: Accesses the `mycollection` collection within the database.\n",
    "- **`insert_one(document)`**: Inserts a single document into the collection. Returns an `InsertOneResult` object containing the ID of the inserted document.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Insert Multiple Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",

    "collection = db['mycollection']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a list of documents to be inserted\n",
    "documents = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"Chicago\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 29, \"city\": \"San Francisco\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"city\": \"Boston\"}\n",

    "result = collection.insert_many(documents)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the inserted_ids\n",
    "print(\"Inserted document IDs:\", result.inserted_ids)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`insert_many(documents)`**: Inserts multiple documents into the collection. Returns an `InsertManyResult` object containing a list of IDs of the inserted documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Format:** Documents are represented as dictionaries (or JSON-like objects) in Python. Each key-value pair corresponds to a field in the document.\n",
    "- **Database and Collection Creation:** MongoDB creates the database and collection automatically if they do not already exist when you insert a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Itâ€™s good practice to include error handling when performing database operations. Hereâ€™s an example with basic error handling:\n",

    "    \n",
    "    # Insert the document into the collection\n",
    "    result = collection.insert_one(document)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Print the inserted_id\n",
    "    print(\"Inserted document ID:\", result.inserted_id)\n",
    "    \n",
    "except errors.PyMongoError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"An error occurred:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`errors.PyMongoError`**: Catches exceptions related to PyMongo operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insert One Document:** Use `insert_one(document)` to insert a single document into a collection.\n",
    "- **Insert Multiple Documents:** Use `insert_many(documents)` to insert multiple documents at once.\n",
    "- **Error Handling:** Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors during database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using PyMongo, you can easily interact with MongoDB to perform various operations including inserting documents, providing a powerful way to work with data in Python applications."

    "The aggregation framework in MongoDB is a powerful tool designed for processing and analyzing data. It allows you to perform complex data transformations, computations, and aggregations on your data. This framework is essential for generating summarized results, filtering and transforming data, and performing complex queries that go beyond simple retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role of the Aggregation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Transformation:**\n",
    "   - The aggregation framework allows you to transform data into a more suitable format for analysis. This includes reshaping data, converting data types, and performing calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Aggregation:**\n",
    "   - It enables you to perform various types of aggregation operations, such as summing, averaging, and counting, across collections of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Filtering:**\n",
    "   - The framework provides powerful filtering capabilities to include or exclude documents based on specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Grouping:**\n",
    "   - You can group documents by specific fields and compute aggregate values for each group, such as the total number of items or the average value in each group.\n",

    "   - The framework supports sorting results and limiting the number of documents returned, allowing you to focus on relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Aggregation Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDBâ€™s aggregation framework is based on a pipeline model, where data passes through a series of stages. Each stage performs a specific operation and passes its result to the next stage. Here are some of the commonly used stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`$match`:** \n",
    "   - Filters documents based on specified criteria.\n",
    "   - Similar to the `find()` method but used in the aggregation pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   { $match: { status: \"active\" } }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`$group`:** \n",
    "   - Groups documents by a specified field and performs aggregation operations like sum, average, min, and max.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   { \n",
    "     $group: { \n",
    "       _id: \"$category\", \n",
    "       totalSales: { $sum: \"$sales\" } \n",
    "     } \n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`$sort`:**\n",
    "   - Sorts documents by specified fields in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   { $sort: { totalSales: -1 } }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`$project`:**\n",
    "   - Reshapes documents by specifying which fields to include or exclude and performing calculations or transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   { \n",
    "     $project: { \n",
    "       item: 1, \n",
    "       totalSales: { $multiply: [\"$price\", \"$quantity\"] } \n",
    "     } \n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`$limit`:**\n",
    "   - Limits the number of documents to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   { $limit: 5 }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "In MongoDB, **sharding** is a crucial concept for managing large datasets and ensuring scalability and performance. Sharding involves distributing data across multiple servers or nodes to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads. Here's an overview of the concept and its significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Sharding?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sharding** is a method used to partition data across multiple servers (shards) in a MongoDB cluster. Each shard holds a subset of the data and is responsible for managing a portion of the data and the associated queries. This partitioning helps distribute the load and improves both read and write performance by parallelizing operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts of Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shard:**\n",
    "   - A shard is a single MongoDB server or replica set that holds a portion of the dataset. In a sharded cluster, there can be multiple shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shard Key:**\n",
    "   - The shard key is a field or combination of fields used to distribute data across shards. It determines how data is partitioned and routed to the appropriate shard.\n",
    "   - Choosing an appropriate shard key is crucial for achieving balanced distribution and efficient querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chunks:**\n",
    "   - Data is divided into chunks based on the shard key. Each chunk contains a subset of the data and is distributed across shards.\n",
    "   - MongoDB automatically manages the distribution of chunks to ensure that data is balanced across shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Config Servers:**\n",
    "   - Config servers store metadata about the sharded cluster, including the mapping of chunks to shards, the shard key ranges, and other configuration details.\n",
    "   - They play a critical role in routing queries to the appropriate shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mongos:**\n",
    "   - Mongos is a routing service that directs client requests to the appropriate shard(s) based on the shard key. It acts as an interface between the client and the sharded cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - Sharding allows MongoDB to scale horizontally by adding more shards to the cluster. This increases the capacity to handle more data and higher query loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance:**\n",
    "   - By distributing data across multiple shards, MongoDB can parallelize queries and updates, leading to improved performance and reduced latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **High Availability:**\n",
    "   - Sharding can be combined with replication to ensure high availability. Each shard can be a replica set, providing redundancy and failover capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficient Querying:**\n",
    "   - Sharding can improve query performance by directing queries to the relevant shards based on the shard key. This minimizes the amount of data that needs to be scanned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations for Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choosing a Shard Key:**\n",
    "   - Selecting an appropriate shard key is critical for balancing data distribution and ensuring efficient queries. A poorly chosen shard key can lead to unbalanced shards and inefficient querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Distribution:**\n",
    "   - MongoDB automatically manages the distribution of chunks across shards. However, it is essential to monitor and manage the distribution to prevent hotspots and ensure even load distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Sharding introduces additional complexity in managing the cluster. This includes managing the configuration, handling data migration between shards, and ensuring consistent performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Aggregation and Joins:**\n",
    "   - Sharded collections can impact the performance of certain operations, such as aggregations and joins, which may require data from multiple shards. MongoDB provides support for distributed aggregations, but performance tuning may be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a large e-commerce application that needs to handle millions of user transactions. Without sharding, a single MongoDB server might become a bottleneck due to the sheer volume of data and traffic. By implementing sharding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Distribution:** Transactions are distributed across multiple shards based on the shard key (e.g., user ID or transaction date).\n",
    "- **Increased Capacity:** Additional shards can be added to handle growing data and user traffic.\n",
    "- **Improved Performance:** Queries and updates are processed in parallel across shards, reducing response times and increasing throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sharding** in MongoDB is essential for managing large datasets and scaling out horizontally. It involves partitioning data across multiple servers, improving performance, and ensuring high availability. While it introduces complexity, proper implementation and management of sharding can significantly enhance the scalability and efficiency of a MongoDB deployment."

    "\n",
    "# Convert the result to a list and print it\n",
    "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Function Definition:** `square(x)` returns the square of `x`.\n",
    "- **Using `map()`:** `map(square, numbers)` applies the `square` function to each element in the `numbers` list.\n",
    "- **Conversion to List:** `list(squared_numbers)` converts the iterator to a list of squared numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `filter()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "- The `filter()` function applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator of the items for which the function returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",

    "- **`iterable:`** An iterable (e.g., list, tuple) whose elements will be tested by the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns:**\n",
    "- An iterator of the items for which the function returns `True`. This can be converted to a list or other data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to filter out only the even numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "- **Conversion to List:** `list(even_numbers)` converts the iterator to a list of even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose:**\n",
    "   - **`map()`**: Transforms each element of an iterable based on a given function.\n",
    "   - **`filter()`**: Filters elements of an iterable based on a condition function, retaining only those elements that meet the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Return Values:**\n",
    "   - **`map()`**: Returns transformed values for each element.\n",
    "   - **`filter()`**: Returns elements that satisfy a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output:**\n",
    "   - **`map()`**: The output is a collection of transformed elements.\n",
    "   - **`filter()`**: The output is a collection of elements that pass the filtering condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`map()`** is used to apply a function to each element of an iterable and return a new iterable of results.\n",
    "- **`filter()`** is used to apply a function that tests a condition and return a new iterable with only the elements that pass the test.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `reduce()` function is versatile and can be used for various tasks that require cumulative operations on a sequence. Its common use cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggregating Values:** Summing, multiplying, finding maximum/minimum.\n",
    "- **Accumulating Results:** Concatenating strings, merging data structures.\n",
    "- **Custom Operations:** Applying custom cumulative operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While `reduce()` can be powerful, it's often less intuitive than using simple loops or list comprehensions. In many cases, alternative approaches (e.g., `sum()` for summing values) may be more readable. Nonetheless, `reduce()` is a useful tool for scenarios where you need to perform complex cumulative operations."

    "To use the `map()` function in Python to create a new list of squares from a given list of numbers, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a Function:** Create a function that calculates the square of a number.\n",
    "2. **Apply `map()`:** Use the `map()` function to apply this square function to each element of the list of numbers.\n",
    "3. **Convert to List:** Convert the result of `map()` (which is an iterator) to a list to get the final list of squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through a complete example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Define the Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a function that takes a number and returns its square:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Create the List of Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a list of numbers that you want to square:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Use `map()` to Apply the Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply the `map()` function to the list of numbers using the `square` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Convert the Result to a List\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `map()` returns an iterator, convert it to a list to see the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squared_list = list(squared_numbers)\n",
    "print(squared_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete Code Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the complete code snippet combining all the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a function that returns the square of a number\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "# List of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use map() to apply the square function to each number in the list\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the map object to a list and print it\n",
    "squared_list = list(squared_numbers)\n",
    "print(squared_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Lambda Function (Alternative Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a lambda function to achieve the same result, which can be more concise:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List of numbers\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use map() with a lambda function to square each number\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x * x, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the map object to a list and print it\n",
    "squared_list = list(squared_numbers)\n",
    "print(squared_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`map()` Function:** Applies a function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator of results.\n",
    "- **Function Definition:** You define a function (or use a lambda) to perform the desired operation (e.g., squaring a number).\n",
    "- **Conversion to List:** Convert the `map` object to a list to get the final list of transformed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `map()` is an effective way to apply a transformation to each element of a list, resulting in a new list of processed values."

    "In PyMongo, which is the Python driver for MongoDB, the `update_many()` method is used to update multiple documents in a collection that match a specified filter. The `upsert` option is a key feature of this method that can significantly affect how the update operation behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role of the `upsert` Option\n",
    "\n",
    "The `upsert` option in the `update_many()` method determines whether to insert a new document if no documents match the filter criteria. Hereâ€™s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`upsert=True`**: If no documents match the filter criteria, a new document is created and inserted into the collection. The new document will contain the updated fields specified in the update operation along with the fields in the filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`upsert=False`** (default): If no documents match the filter criteria, no new document is inserted, and the operation affects only the documents that match the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use `upsert` with `update_many`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax of `update_many()` with `upsert` option:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "collection.update_many(\n",
    "    filter,\n",
    "    update,\n",
    "    upsert=True/False\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`filter`**: A query that specifies which documents to update.\n",
    "- **`update`**: An update document that specifies the modifications to apply.\n",
    "- **`upsert`**: A boolean option (`True` or `False`) to specify whether to insert a new document if no matching documents are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a collection named `products` and you want to update the stock quantity for all products of a certain category. If no products of that category exist, you want to insert a new document with default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a complete example demonstrating the use of the `upsert` option with `update_many()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "collection = db['products']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the filter to match documents\n",
    "filter = {'category': 'electronics'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the update operation\n",
    "update = {\n",
    "    '$set': {'stock': 100}\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform the update with upsert=True\n",
    "result = collection.update_many(filter, update, upsert=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the result\n",
    "print(f'Matched documents: {result.matched_count}')\n",
    "print(f'Updated documents: {result.modified_count}')\n",
    "print(f'Upserted ID: {result.upserted_id}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filter:** `{ 'category': 'electronics' }` â€” This specifies that you want to update documents where the category is `electronics`.\n",
    "- **Update:** `{ '$set': { 'stock': 100 } }` â€” This sets the stock quantity to 100.\n",
    "- **Upsert:** `True` â€” If no documents match the filter, a new document will be inserted with the category `electronics` and stock `100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`result.matched_count`**: Number of documents matched by the filter. If no documents match, this count will be `0`.\n",
    "- **`result.modified_count`**: Number of documents that were updated.\n",
    "- **`result.upserted_id`**: The `_id` of the newly inserted document if an upsert occurred. If no upsert happened, this will be `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The `upsert` option in the `update_many()` method in PyMongo plays a critical role in controlling the behavior of update operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`upsert=True`**: Ensures that a new document is created and inserted if no documents match the filter, making it useful for ensuring data presence.\n",
    "- **`upsert=False`**: Restricts the operation to only update existing documents that match the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `upsert` helps manage scenarios where you want to both update and ensure the existence of documents in a collection efficiently."
