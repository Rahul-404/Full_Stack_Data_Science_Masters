    "Let's delve into inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) and its importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a core concept in object-oriented programming that allows one class (known as the subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (known as the superclass or base class). This relationship enables a new class to build upon or extend the functionality of an existing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Class (Superclass):** The class that provides common attributes and methods. It serves as the foundation that other classes can inherit from.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Derived Class (Subclass):** The class that inherits from the base class. It can use the attributes and methods of the base class and can also have additional features or override existing methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Inheritance Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability:**\n",
    "   - Inheritance allows you to define common functionality in a base class and reuse it in multiple derived classes. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to manage and update code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extensibility:**\n",
    "   - It facilitates extending the functionality of an existing class without modifying it. You can add new features or change behaviors by creating new derived classes, thus adhering to the Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hierarchical Classification:**\n",
    "   - Inheritance helps organize and model relationships between classes in a hierarchical structure. For instance, you can have a base class `Animal` with subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat`, each of which inherits characteristics from `Animal` but also has specific attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   - Inheritance supports polymorphism, where a base class reference can point to objects of derived classes. This allows methods to be called on base class references, which can exhibit different behaviors depending on the actual subclass type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example in Python\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Ambiguity:**\n",
    "   - **Single Inheritance:** Generally avoids ambiguity, as there is only one base class to consider.\n",
    "   - **Multiple Inheritance:** Can introduce ambiguity, particularly if multiple base classes have methods or attributes with the same names. This can lead to the \"Diamond Problem,\" where it's unclear which method or attribute should be used if they are defined in more than one base class.\n",

    "3. **Implementation Complexity:**\n",
    "   - **Single Inheritance:** Easier to implement and understand, with a straightforward relationship between classes.\n",

Understanding the \"protected\" access modifier and how it differs from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers is crucial for designing robust and maintainable class hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Modifiers Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Public:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Members marked as `public` are accessible from anywhere in the program. There are no restrictions on their access.\n",
    "   - **Usage:** Used for methods and attributes that need to be accessed by any part of the program, including outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Protected:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Members marked as `protected` are accessible within the class itself and by derived (subclass) classes. They are not accessible from outside the class hierarchy.\n",
    "   - **Usage:** Used for attributes and methods that should be accessible to subclasses but not to the general public. This allows subclasses to use and extend base class functionality while keeping it hidden from outside code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Private:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Members marked as `private` are only accessible within the class that defines them. They are not accessible from outside the class or by derived classes.\n",
    "   - **Usage:** Used for internal details of a class that should not be exposed to or modified by outside classes or subclasses. This ensures encapsulation and protects the integrity of the class's internal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance of the \"Protected\" Access Modifier\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation and Data Hiding:**\n",
    "   - The `protected` modifier strikes a balance between encapsulation and flexibility. It allows a derived class to access and modify certain attributes or methods of its base class, while still hiding these details from code outside the class hierarchy. This helps maintain a clean and controlled interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extensibility:**\n",
    "   - By using `protected`, you allow derived classes to build on or modify the behavior defined in the base class. This is useful when you want to provide a default implementation in the base class but allow subclasses to customize or extend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance-Based Design:**\n",
    "   - `Protected` members are essential in inheritance-based design patterns, where derived classes need to work with certain functionalities of the base class. It ensures that subclasses can inherit and override behaviors without exposing base class internals to all clients of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences from \"Private\" and \"Public\" Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visibility:**\n",
    "   - **Public:** Accessible from any part of the program, including outside the class and its subclasses.\n",
    "   - **Protected:** Accessible only within the class and its subclasses, but not from outside the class hierarchy.\n",
    "   - **Private:** Accessible only within the defining class; not visible to subclasses or external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance:**\n",
    "   - **Public:** Methods and attributes marked as `public` can be accessed by any derived class and can be overridden if the access level allows it.\n",
    "   - **Protected:** Methods and attributes marked as `protected` can be accessed and overridden by derived classes, but are hidden from non-derived code.\n",
    "   - **Private:** Methods and attributes marked as `private` are completely hidden from derived classes and outside code; they cannot be accessed or overridden.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn’t enforce access control strictly like some other languages (e.g., Java or C++). Instead, it uses a naming convention:\n",
    "\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calling the Base Class Constructor:**\n",
    "   - In the `Dog` class constructor (`__init__` method), `super().__init__(name)` is used to call the constructor of the `Animal` class. This initializes the `name` attribute in the `Animal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extending Base Class Methods:**\n",
    "   - The `speak` method in the `Dog` class uses `super().speak()` to call the `speak` method of the `Animal` class. After calling the base class method, it adds additional behavior specific to the `Dog` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using `super`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability:**\n",
    "   - By calling methods and constructors from the base class, you can reuse existing functionality and avoid redundant code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintainability:**\n",
    "   - Using `super()` makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as it abstracts away direct references to the parent class. If you later change the base class or its name, the code in derived classes remains correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Support for Multiple Inheritance:**\n",
    "   - In languages that support multiple inheritance (like Python), `super()` helps ensure that the correct methods are called in the correct order, thanks to the method resolution order (MRO).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super` keyword is a powerful tool in inheritance, enabling derived classes to call and extend methods and constructors of their parent classes. It promotes code reuse, improves maintainability, and supports complex class hierarchies in an organized manner."

    "1. **Base Class `BankAccount`:**\n",
    "   - **`__init__` Method:** Initializes `account_number` and `balance` attributes.\n",
    "   - **`deposit` Method:** Adds funds to the account balance.\n",
    "   - **`withdraw` Method:** Withdraws funds from the account balance.\n",
    "   - **`display_info` Method:** Returns a string with the account number and balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Derived Class `SavingsAccount`:**\n",
    "   - **`__init__` Method:** Initializes `account_number`, `balance`, and `interest_rate` using `super()` to call the base class constructor.\n",
    "   - **`calculate_interest` Method:** Calculates the interest based on the balance and interest rate.\n",
    "   - **`display_info` Method:** Extends the base class `display_info` method to include the interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Derived Class `CheckingAccount`:**\n",
    "   - **`__init__` Method:** Initializes `account_number`, `balance`, and `monthly_fee` using `super()` to call the base class constructor.\n",
    "   - **`deduct_fees` Method:** Deducts a monthly fee from the account balance if sufficient funds are available.\n",
    "   - **`display_info` Method:** Extends the base class `display_info` method to include the monthly fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`SavingsAccount`** and **`CheckingAccount`** classes inherit from `BankAccount` and add their specific features.\n",
    "- Methods such as `calculate_interest` and `deduct_fees` provide additional functionality specific to each account type.\n",
    "- The `display_info` method in each derived class includes relevant additional information beyond the basic account details.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach effectively demonstrates how inheritance allows for extending and customizing functionality in derived classes while leveraging shared functionality from the base class."
