    "In todays class we will try to understand how to pass data through a form, because there is difference in between passing data through a `form`, passing a data through a `JSON`and passign a data through `URL`. so we already have seen example of google search.\n",

    "When we try to search something on google, so typed query we get appended  into an `URL` and then it will try to send to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now sent data appending into `URL` is exposed to every one. at same point of time if we talk about `GMAIL`, here when ever you try to pass a data it will not be visible inside your `URL` and no one will be able to see it. so simply it behaves like a form. where you are going to pass a data through a body.\n",
