    "\n",
    "At the intermediate level, you need to dive deeper into **model building**, **training**, and **fine-tuning**, as well as work with data effectively. Here's a breakdown of the key areas you should focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) **Model Building**\n",

    "  - **Sequential Model**: Building models layer-by-layer using `tf.keras.Sequential()`.\n",
    "  - **Functional API**: For more complex architectures, such as multi-input or multi-output models, or when you need shared layers, use the Keras functional API.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Layer Types**: Know how to implement different types of layers, such as:\n",
    "  - **Dense layers** (`tf.keras.layers.Dense`).\n",
    "  - **Convolutional layers** for computer vision (`tf.keras.layers.Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Custom Models**: Be able to create custom models by subclassing `tf.keras.Model` and defining the `build()` and `call()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) **Advanced Tensor Operations**\n",
    "- **Tensor Operations**: Similar to PyTorch, TensorFlow provides a rich set of tensor operations such as reshaping, slicing, element-wise operations, and reductions.\n",
    "  - Work with **broadcasting**, **matrix multiplications**, **slicing**, and **reductions** like `sum()`, `mean()`, etc.\n",
    "  - Use `tf.reshape()`, `tf.transpose()`, `tf.expand_dims()`, etc., for reshaping tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Device Placement**: Be comfortable with moving data to different devices (CPU/GPU) with `tf.device()` or `.gpu()` and ensuring that tensors and models are using the GPU for faster computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) **Optimization and Regularization**\n",
    "- **Optimizers**: You should know how to use different optimizers for training deep learning models in TensorFlow:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### d) **Training and Evaluation**\n",

    "  - **`Model.compile()`**: Setting the loss function, optimizer, and metrics.\n",
    "  - **`Model.fit()`**: Training models, handling callbacks (e.g., early stopping, model checkpointing).\n",
    "  - **Custom Training Loops**: Using `tf.GradientTape()` for backpropagation and manual updates to weights if needed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Know how to evaluate models using `model.evaluate()` or custom evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e) **Model Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation**: Although TensorFlow doesn’t have built-in cross-validation methods (like `scikit-learn`), you can manually split data into multiple subsets to validate your model’s performance.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement and optimize hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, or network architectures using:\n",
    "  - **Keras Tuner** for hyperparameter optimization.\n",

    "  - Use `map()` to preprocess data before feeding it into the model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Image Preprocessing**: For computer vision tasks, use `tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` for real-time data augmentation like random flips, rotations, zooms, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Preprocessing**: For NLP tasks, use **`Tokenizer`** and **`pad_sequences`** to handle text data and word embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec).\n",
